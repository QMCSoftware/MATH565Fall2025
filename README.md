- Track changes over time

**Steps:**
1. Click the **"Fork"** button (top right of this page).

### üì¶ Option 2: **Use this template**

Choose this if you want to:
- Start a **fresh, independent copy** of the materials
- Do **personal projects** that don't need updates from the instructor
- Avoid GitHub fork restrictions (e.g., if you already forked another repo with the same name)

**Steps:**
1. Click the **"Use this template"** button (above the file list).
2. Create a new repo under your GitHub account.
3. Clone and begin working independently.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This will **not receive updates** from the original repo unless manually copied.
