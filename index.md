# Welcome to MATH 565 (Fall 2025)

## <span style="color: darkgreen;">This website is continually under construction </span>

## Course Description 
This course teaches students Monte Carlo simulation techniques, focusing on applications in financial risk management, uncertainty quantification, and Bayesian inference. These sampling methods are used to compute the expected values, quantiles, and densities. Advanced techniques, such as Quasi-Monte Carlo methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo, are covered. Students will gain experience using popular computer languages for Monte Carlo computations.

**Enrollment:** Graduate elective

* _Brief bio:_ Fred J. Hickernell is professor of applied mathematics. His research focuses on increasing the efficiency of computer simulations and determining justifiable stopping criteria for simulation. A major area of interest is Monte Carlo methods. 

  Hickernell’s research has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. In 2016, he received the Joseph F. Traub Prize for Achievement in Information-Based Complexity. He has served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Complexity, Mathematics of Computation, and the SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis.

  Hickernell received his Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and his B.A. in mathematics and physics from Pomona College. He came to Illinois Tech in 2005 as department chair and has also served as vice provost for research.  Before coming to Illinois Tech, Hickernell was a professor in mathematics at Hong Kong Baptist University and assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Southern California. 
  
  Hickernell speaks Cantonese and enjoys Chinese food. His married with adult children.  His most important identity is a disciple of Jesus.

<summary><strong>Illinois Tech’s Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information</strong></summary>
Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.
Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. 
You can report sexual harassment electronically at [iit.edu/incidentreport](https://iit.edu/incidentreport), which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at [foster@illinoistech.edu](mailto: foster@illinoistech.edu).
For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at [student.health@illinoistech.edu](mailto: student.health@illinoistech.edu) or (312)567-7550.

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance website at [www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources](https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources).
