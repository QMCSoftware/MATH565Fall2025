# Assignments

## Ground rules for assignments

* You may work in groups of up to **three students**, and the group may change from one assignment to the next.  
* For each assignment, I will create a **group set in Canvas**; you will sign up to form your group.  
* **Only one person per group submits** the assignment in Canvas. The submission is automatically shared with all group members.  
* Grades and feedback are shared with the whole group. By default, all members receive the **same grade**.  
* Assignments are due by **11:59 PM** on the due date.  
* Each submission must include **two separate files**:  
  <ol>
    <li>
      A self-contained, working copy of  
      <ul>
        <li>A Jupyter notebook that runs under the <code>qmcpy</code> environment, OR</li>
        <li>A MATLAB Live file, OR</li>
        <li>An equivalent.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <div style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 0em;">AND</div>

    <li>
      A PDF of item&nbsp;1, including the output.
    </li>
  </ol>
